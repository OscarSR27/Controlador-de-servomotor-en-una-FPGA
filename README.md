## Description

Implementation of a digital control system for a direct current servomotor CI-23004. The implementation was carried out using the Verilog hardware description language, 
the Spartan 6 XC6SLX16-CSG324C FPGA, and the Xilinx ISE Design Suite14.7 program. The purpose of the system is to precisely control the angular position of the servomotor.
